# Multilanguage Support

This rule ensures the bot supports multiple languages and language files are easy to manage and extend.

Relevant files:
- [memory-bank/business_analysis.md](mdc:memory-bank/business_analysis.md)
- [config.py](mdc:config.py)
- Any JSON files in the project for language storage
